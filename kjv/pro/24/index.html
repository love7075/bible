It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment. </p><p> 24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him: </p><p> 25 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them. </p><p> 26 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer. </p><p> 27 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the field; and afterwards build thine house. </p><p> 28 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and deceive not with thy lips. </p><p> 29 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will render to the man according to his work. </p><p> 30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; </p><p> 31 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down. </p><p> 32 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and received instruction. </p><p> 33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep: </p><p> 34 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want as an armed man. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/pro/23">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/pro/25">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
