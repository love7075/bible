And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: </p><p> 20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. </p><p> 21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. </p><p> 22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; </p><p> 23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. </p><p> 24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. </p><p> 25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken: </p><p> 26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? </p><p> 27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. </p><p> 28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. </p><p> 29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. </p><p> 30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. </p><p> 31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. </p><p> 32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? </p><p> 33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, </p><p> 34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. </p><p> 35 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. </p><p> 36 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you. </p><p> 37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. </p><p> 38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? </p><p> 39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. </p><p> 40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. </p><p> 41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here any meat? </p><p> 42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. </p><p> 43 And he took it, and did eat before them. </p><p> 44 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. </p><p> 45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, </p><p> 46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: </p><p> 47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. </p><p> 48 And ye are witnesses of these things. </p><p> 49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. </p><p> 50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. </p><p> 51 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. </p><p> 52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: </p><p> 53 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/luk/23">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/1">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
