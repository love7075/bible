Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour. </p><p> 28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. </p><p> 29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. </p><p> 30 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. </p><p> 31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. </p><p> 32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. </p><p> 33 This he said, signifying what death he should die. </p><p> 34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man? </p><p> 35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. </p><p> 36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them. </p><p> 37 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: </p><p> 38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? </p><p> 39 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, </p><p> 40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. </p><p> 41 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. </p><p> 42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: </p><p> 43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. </p><p> 44 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me. </p><p> 45 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. </p><p> 46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. </p><p> 47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. </p><p> 48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. </p><p> 49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. </p><p> 50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/11">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/13">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
