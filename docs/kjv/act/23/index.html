Farewell. </p><p> 31 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought him by night to Antipatris. </p><p> 32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle: </p><p> 33 Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him. </p><p> 34 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia; </p><p> 35 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod&#39;s judgment hall. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/act/22">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/act/24">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
