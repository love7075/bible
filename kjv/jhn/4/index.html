约翰福音 4 </span> </div> <!-- 右侧：上一章 / 下一章 --> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 text-blue-600"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/3">上一章</a> <a href="/kjv/jhn/5">下一章</a> </div> </div>  <div class="p-2 gray-400"> <p> 1 When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John, </p><p> 2 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,) </p><p> 3 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee. </p><p> 4 And he must needs go through Samaria. </p><p> 5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph. </p><p> 6 Now Jacob&#39;s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. </p><p> 7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink. </p><p> 8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) </p><p> 9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. </p><p> 10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. </p><p> 11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? </p><p> 12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? </p><p> 13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again: </p><p> 14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. </p><p> 15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. </p><p> 16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither. </p><p> 17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband: </p><p> 18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly. </p><p> 19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. </p><p> 20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. </p><p> 21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father. </p><p> 22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. </p><p> 23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. </p><p> 24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. </p><p> 25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things. </p><p> 26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he. </p><p> 27 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? </p><p> 28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, </p><p> 29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ? </p><p> 30 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. </p><p> 31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. </p><p> 32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of. </p><p> 33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? </p><p> 34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work. </p><p> 35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. </p><p> 36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. </p><p> 37 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. </p><p> 38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. </p><p> 39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. </p><p> 40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. </p><p> 41 And many more believed because of his own word; </p><p> 42 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world. </p><p> 43 Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee. </p><p> 44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. </p><p> 45 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. </p><p> 46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum. </p><p> 47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. </p><p> 48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe. </p><p> 49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. </p><p> 50 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way. </p><p> 51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. </p><p> 52 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. </p><p> 53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house. </p><p> 54 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/3">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/5">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
