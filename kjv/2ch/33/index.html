Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God. </p><p> 14 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah. </p><p> 15 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city. </p><p> 16 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to serve the LORD God of Israel. </p><p> 17 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places, yet unto the LORD their God only. </p><p> 18 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel. </p><p> 19 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the seers. </p><p> 20 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead. </p><p> 21 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and reigned two years in Jerusalem. </p><p> 22 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them; </p><p> 23 And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more. </p><p> 24 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his own house. </p><p> 25 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2ch/32">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2ch/34">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
