Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee. </p><p> 20 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free. </p><p> 21 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering. </p><p> 22 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven him. </p><p> 23 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of. </p><p> 24 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD withal. </p><p> 25 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God. </p><p> 26 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times. </p><p> 27 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard. </p><p> 28 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD. </p><p> 29 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness. </p><p> 30 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD. </p><p> 31 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God. </p><p> 32 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD. </p><p> 33 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him. </p><p> 34 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God. </p><p> 35 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure. </p><p> 36 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt. </p><p> 37 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/lvs/18">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/lvs/20">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
