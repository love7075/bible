And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar. </p><p> 2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: </p><p> 3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father; </p><p> 4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; </p><p> 5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws. </p><p> 6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar: </p><p> 7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon. </p><p> 8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife. </p><p> 9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her. </p><p> 10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us. </p><p> 11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death. </p><p> 12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him. </p><p> 13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great: </p><p> 14 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him. </p><p> 15 For all the wells which his father&#39;s servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth. </p><p> 16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we. </p><p> 17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there. </p><p> 18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them. </p><p> 19 And Isaac&#39;s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water. </p><p> 20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac&#39;s herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him. </p><p> 21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah. </p><p> 22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land. </p><p> 23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba. </p><p> 24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham&#39;s sake. </p><p> 25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac&#39;s servants digged a well. </p><p> 26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army. </p><p> 27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? </p><p> 28 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee; </p><p> 29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD. </p><p> 30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink. </p><p> 31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace. </p><p> 32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac&#39;s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water. </p><p> 33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day. </p><p> 34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: </p><p> 35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/25">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/27">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
