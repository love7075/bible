使徒行传 28 </span> </div> <!-- 右侧：上一章 / 下一章 --> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 text-blue-600"> <a href="/kjv/act/27">上一章</a> <a href="/kjv/rom/1">下一章</a> </div> </div>  <div class="p-2 gray-400"> <p> 1 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita. </p><p> 2 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold. </p><p> 3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. </p><p> 4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. </p><p> 5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. </p><p> 6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god. </p><p> 7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously. </p><p> 8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him. </p><p> 9 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed: </p><p> 10 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. </p><p> 11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. </p><p> 12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. </p><p> 13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: </p><p> 14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. </p><p> 15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage. </p><p> 16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him. </p><p> 17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. </p><p> 18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me. </p><p> 19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of. </p><p> 20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain. </p><p> 21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee. </p><p> 22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against. </p><p> 23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening. </p><p> 24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not. </p><p> 25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers, </p><p> 26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive: </p><p> 27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them. </p><p> 28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it. </p><p> 29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves. </p><p> 30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him, </p><p> 31 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/act/27">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/rom/1">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
