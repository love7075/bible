Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet. </p><p> 8 But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead. </p><p> 9 For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. </p><p> 10 And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death. </p><p> 11 For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. </p><p> 12 Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good. </p><p> 13 Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful. </p><p> 14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin. </p><p> 15 For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I. </p><p> 16 If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good. </p><p> 17 Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. </p><p> 18 For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. </p><p> 19 For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do. </p><p> 20 Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. </p><p> 21 I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me. </p><p> 22 For I delight in the law of God after the inward man: </p><p> 23 But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members. </p><p> 24 O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? </p><p> 25 I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/rom/6">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/rom/8">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
