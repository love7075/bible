I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert. </p><p> 20 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen. </p><p> 21 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise. </p><p> 22 But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel. </p><p> 23 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense. </p><p> 24 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities. </p><p> 25 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins. </p><p> 26 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified. </p><p> 27 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me. </p><p> 28 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/isa/42">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/isa/44">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
