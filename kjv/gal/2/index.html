God forbid. </p><p> 18 For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. </p><p> 19 For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. </p><p> 20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. </p><p> 21 I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gal/1">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gal/3">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
