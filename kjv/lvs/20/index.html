he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones. </p><p> 3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name. </p><p> 4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not: </p><p> 5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people. </p><p> 6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people. </p><p> 7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD your God. </p><p> 8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which sanctify you. </p><p> 9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him. </p><p> 10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man&#39;s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour&#39;s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death. </p><p> 11 And the man that lieth with his father&#39;s wife hath uncovered his father&#39;s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. </p><p> 12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall be upon them. </p><p> 13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. </p><p> 14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you. </p><p> 15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death: and ye shall slay the beast. </p><p> 16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them. </p><p> 17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father&#39;s daughter, or his mother&#39;s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister&#39;s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity. </p><p> 18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut off from among their people. </p><p> 19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother&#39;s sister, nor of thy father&#39;s sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they shall bear their iniquity. </p><p> 20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle&#39;s wife, he hath uncovered his uncle&#39;s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless. </p><p> 21 And if a man shall take his brother&#39;s wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath uncovered his brother&#39;s nakedness; they shall be childless. </p><p> 22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue you not out. </p><p> 23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them. </p><p> 24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other people. </p><p> 25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean. </p><p> 26 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have severed you from other people, that ye should be mine. </p><p> 27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones: their blood shall be upon them. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/lvs/19">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/lvs/21">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
