This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice. </p><p> 22 The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness. </p><p> 23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail! </p><p> 24 As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence; </p><p> 25 And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. </p><p> 26 And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die. </p><p> 27 But to the land whereunto they desire to return, thither shall they not return. </p><p> 28 Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not? </p><p> 29 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD. </p><p> 30 Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jer/21">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jer/23">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
