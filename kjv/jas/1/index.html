For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. </p><p> 7 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. </p><p> 8 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways. </p><p> 9 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: </p><p> 10 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. </p><p> 11 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. </p><p> 12 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. </p><p> 13 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: </p><p> 14 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. </p><p> 15 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death. </p><p> 16 Do not err, my beloved brethren. </p><p> 17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. </p><p> 18 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. </p><p> 19 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath: </p><p> 20 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God. </p><p> 21 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls. </p><p> 22 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. </p><p> 23 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass: </p><p> 24 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was. </p><p> 25 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed. </p><p> 26 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man&#39;s religion is vain. </p><p> 27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jas/0">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jas/2">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
