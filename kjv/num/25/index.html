So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. </p><p> 9 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand. </p><p> 10 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, </p><p> 11 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy. </p><p> 12 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: </p><p> 13 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel. </p><p> 14 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites. </p><p> 15 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian. </p><p> 16 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, </p><p> 17 Vex the Midianites, and smite them: </p><p> 18 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor&#39;s sake. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/num/24">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/num/26">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
