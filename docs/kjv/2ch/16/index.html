Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars. </p><p> 10 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time. </p><p> 11 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. </p><p> 12 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians. </p><p> 13 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign. </p><p> 14 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries&#39; art: and they made a very great burning for him. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2ch/15">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2ch/17">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
