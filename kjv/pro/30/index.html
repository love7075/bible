There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough: </p><p> 16 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough. </p><p> 17 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it. </p><p> 18 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not: </p><p> 19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid. </p><p> 20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness. </p><p> 21 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear: </p><p> 22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat; </p><p> 23 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress. </p><p> 24 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise: </p><p> 25 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer; </p><p> 26 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; </p><p> 27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; </p><p> 28 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings&#39; palaces. </p><p> 29 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going: </p><p> 30 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any; </p><p> 31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up. </p><p> 32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth. </p><p> 33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/pro/29">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/pro/31">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
