And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped. </p><p> 4 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also. </p><p> 5 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead? </p><p> 6 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him. </p><p> 7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I. </p><p> 8 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite. </p><p> 9 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me. </p><p> 10 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord. </p><p> 11 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: </p><p> 12 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword. </p><p> 13 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite. </p><p> 14 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD&#39;s anointed? </p><p> 15 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died. </p><p> 16 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD&#39;s anointed. </p><p> 17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son: </p><p> 18 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.) </p><p> 19 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen! </p><p> 20 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph. </p><p> 21 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil. </p><p> 22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty. </p><p> 23 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions. </p><p> 24 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel. </p><p> 25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places. </p><p> 26 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women. </p><p> 27 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished! </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2sa/0">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2sa/2">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
