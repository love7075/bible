He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ. </p><p> 17 And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect. </p><p> 18 For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise. </p><p> 19 Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator. </p><p> 20 Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one. </p><p> 21 Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law. </p><p> 22 But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe. </p><p> 23 But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed. </p><p> 24 Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith. </p><p> 25 But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster. </p><p> 26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. </p><p> 27 For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. </p><p> 28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus. </p><p> 29 And if ye be Christ&#39;s, then are ye Abraham&#39;s seed, and heirs according to the promise. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gal/2">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gal/4">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
