Selah. </p><p> 8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest. </p><p> 9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city. </p><p> 10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it. </p><p> 11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets. </p><p> 12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him: </p><p> 13 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. </p><p> 14 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company. </p><p> 15 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them. </p><p> 16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me. </p><p> 17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice. </p><p> 18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me. </p><p> 19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. </p><p> 20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant. </p><p> 21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. </p><p> 22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved. </p><p> 23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/psa/54">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/psa/56">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
