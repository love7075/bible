What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not. </p><p> 23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread: </p><p> 24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. </p><p> 25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. </p><p> 26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord&#39;s death till he come. </p><p> 27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. </p><p> 28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. </p><p> 29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord&#39;s body. </p><p> 30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. </p><p> 31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. </p><p> 32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. </p><p> 33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another. </p><p> 34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1co/10">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1co/12">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
