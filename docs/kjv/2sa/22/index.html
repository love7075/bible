and who is a rock, save our God? </p><p> 33 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect. </p><p> 34 He maketh my feet like hinds&#39; feet: and setteth me upon my high places. </p><p> 35 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. </p><p> 36 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great. </p><p> 37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip. </p><p> 38 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them. </p><p> 39 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet. </p><p> 40 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me. </p><p> 41 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me. </p><p> 42 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD, but he answered them not. </p><p> 43 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad. </p><p> 44 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me. </p><p> 45 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me. </p><p> 46 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places. </p><p> 47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation. </p><p> 48 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me, </p><p> 49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. </p><p> 50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name. </p><p> 51 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2sa/21">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2sa/23">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
