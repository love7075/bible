Come, see the place where the Lord lay. </p><p> 7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you. </p><p> 8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word. </p><p> 9 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him. </p><p> 10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me. </p><p> 11 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done. </p><p> 12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, </p><p> 13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. </p><p> 14 And if this come to the governor&#39;s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you. </p><p> 15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day. </p><p> 16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them. </p><p> 17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. </p><p> 18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. </p><p> 19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: </p><p> 20 Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mat/27">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mrk/1">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
