And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken. </p><p> 3 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses. </p><p> 4 And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? </p><p> 5 Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing. </p><p> 6 And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words. </p><p> 7 And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words? God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing: </p><p> 8 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks&#39; mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord&#39;s house silver or gold? </p><p> 9 With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord&#39;s bondmen. </p><p> 10 And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless. </p><p> 11 Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack. </p><p> 12 And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin&#39;s sack. </p><p> 13 Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city. </p><p> 14 And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph&#39;s house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground. </p><p> 15 And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine? </p><p> 16 And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord&#39;s servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found. </p><p> 17 And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father. </p><p> 18 Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord&#39;s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. </p><p> 19 My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? </p><p> 20 And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. </p><p> 21 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. </p><p> 22 And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die. </p><p> 23 And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more. </p><p> 24 And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord. </p><p> 25 And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food. </p><p> 26 And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man&#39;s face, except our youngest brother be with us. </p><p> 27 And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons: </p><p> 28 And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since: </p><p> 29 And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. </p><p> 30 Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad&#39;s life; </p><p> 31 It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. </p><p> 32 For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever. </p><p> 33 Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren. </p><p> 34 For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/43">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/45">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
