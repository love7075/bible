And they said, So do, as thou hast said. </p><p> 6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth. </p><p> 7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it. </p><p> 8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat. </p><p> 9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. </p><p> 10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. </p><p> 11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. </p><p> 12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? </p><p> 13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? </p><p> 14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. </p><p> 15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh. </p><p> 16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way. </p><p> 17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do; </p><p> 18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? </p><p> 19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. </p><p> 20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; </p><p> 21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know. </p><p> 22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD. </p><p> 23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? </p><p> 24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? </p><p> 25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? </p><p> 26 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. </p><p> 27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes: </p><p> 28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it. </p><p> 29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty&#39;s sake. </p><p> 30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there. </p><p> 31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty&#39;s sake. </p><p> 32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten&#39;s sake. </p><p> 33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/17">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/19">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
