And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews&#39; children. </p><p> 7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh&#39;s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? </p><p> 8 And Pharaoh&#39;s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child&#39;s mother. </p><p> 9 And Pharaoh&#39;s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it. </p><p> 10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh&#39;s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. </p><p> 11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren. </p><p> 12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. </p><p> 13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? </p><p> 14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. </p><p> 15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. </p><p> 16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father&#39;s flock. </p><p> 17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. </p><p> 18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon to day? </p><p> 19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. </p><p> 20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. </p><p> 21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. </p><p> 22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. </p><p> 23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage. </p><p> 24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. </p><p> 25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/exo/1">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/exo/3">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
