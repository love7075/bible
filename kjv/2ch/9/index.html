So she turned, and went away to her own land, she and her servants. </p><p> 13 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold; </p><p> 14 Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to Solomon. </p><p> 15 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target. </p><p> 16 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. </p><p> 17 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with pure gold. </p><p> 18 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the stays: </p><p> 19 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom. </p><p> 20 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted of in the days of Solomon. </p><p> 21 For the king&#39;s ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. </p><p> 22 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom. </p><p> 23 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart. </p><p> 24 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. </p><p> 25 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem. </p><p> 26 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt. </p><p> 27 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance. </p><p> 28 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of all lands. </p><p> 29 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat? </p><p> 30 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. </p><p> 31 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2ch/8">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2ch/10">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
