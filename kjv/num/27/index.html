Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father. </p><p> 5 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD. </p><p> 6 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, </p><p> 7 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father&#39;s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. </p><p> 8 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. </p><p> 9 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. </p><p> 10 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father&#39;s brethren. </p><p> 11 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses. </p><p> 12 And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. </p><p> 13 And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered. </p><p> 14 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. </p><p> 15 And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, </p><p> 16 Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, </p><p> 17 Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd. </p><p> 18 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him; </p><p> 19 And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight. </p><p> 20 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. </p><p> 21 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation. </p><p> 22 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation: </p><p> 23 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/num/26">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/num/28">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
