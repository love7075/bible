And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. </p><p> 30 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me. </p><p> 31 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? </p><p> 32 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased. </p><p> 33 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. </p><p> 34 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret. </p><p> 35 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that were diseased; </p><p> 36 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mat/13">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mat/15">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
