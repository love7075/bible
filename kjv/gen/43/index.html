If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved. </p><p> 15 And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph. </p><p> 16 And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. </p><p> 17 And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph&#39;s house. </p><p> 18 And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph&#39;s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. </p><p> 19 And they came near to the steward of Joseph&#39;s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, </p><p> 20 And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: </p><p> 21 And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man&#39;s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. </p><p> 22 And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. </p><p> 23 And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them. </p><p> 24 And the man brought the men into Joseph&#39;s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. </p><p> 25 And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. </p><p> 26 And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. </p><p> 27 And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? </p><p> 28 And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance. </p><p> 29 And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother&#39;s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. </p><p> 30 And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. </p><p> 31 And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. </p><p> 32 And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. </p><p> 33 And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. </p><p> 34 And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but Benjamin&#39;s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/42">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/44">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
