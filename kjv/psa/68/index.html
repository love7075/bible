Selah. </p><p> 20 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death. </p><p> 21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses. </p><p> 22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea: </p><p> 23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same. </p><p> 24 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary. </p><p> 25 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels. </p><p> 26 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel. </p><p> 27 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali. </p><p> 28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us. </p><p> 29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee. </p><p> 30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war. </p><p> 31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God. </p><p> 32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah: </p><p> 33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice. </p><p> 34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds. </p><p> 35 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/psa/67">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/psa/69">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
