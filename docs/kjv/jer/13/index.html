For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered, and thy heels made bare. </p><p> 23 Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. </p><p> 24 Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness. </p><p> 25 This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood. </p><p> 26 Therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear. </p><p> 27 I have seen thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, and thine abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be? </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jer/12">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jer/14">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
