But while their meat was yet in their mouths, </p><p> 31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel. </p><p> 32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. </p><p> 33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. </p><p> 34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. </p><p> 35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. </p><p> 36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. </p><p> 37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. </p><p> 38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. </p><p> 39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. </p><p> 40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! </p><p> 41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. </p><p> 42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. </p><p> 43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: </p><p> 44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. </p><p> 45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. </p><p> 46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. </p><p> 47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. </p><p> 48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. </p><p> 49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. </p><p> 50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; </p><p> 51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: </p><p> 52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. </p><p> 53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. </p><p> 54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. </p><p> 55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents. </p><p> 56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: </p><p> 57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. </p><p> 58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. </p><p> 59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: </p><p> 60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; </p><p> 61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy&#39;s hand. </p><p> 62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. </p><p> 63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. </p><p> 64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. </p><p> 65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. </p><p> 66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. </p><p> 67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: </p><p> 68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved. </p><p> 69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. </p><p> 70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: </p><p> 71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance. </p><p> 72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/psa/77">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/psa/79">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
