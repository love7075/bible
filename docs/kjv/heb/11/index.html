for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets: </p><p> 33 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions, </p><p> 34 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens. </p><p> 35 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection: </p><p> 36 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment: </p><p> 37 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented; </p><p> 38 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth. </p><p> 39 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise: </p><p> 40 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/heb/10">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/heb/12">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
