Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings? </p><p> 15 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; </p><p> 16 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure. </p><p> 17 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off. </p><p> 18 Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers? </p><p> 19 Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand. </p><p> 20 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. </p><p> 21 But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby. </p><p> 22 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us. </p><p> 23 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey. </p><p> 24 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/isa/32">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/isa/34">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
