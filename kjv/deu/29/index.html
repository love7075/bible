what meaneth the heat of this great anger? </p><p> 25 Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: </p><p> 26 For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them: </p><p> 27 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book: </p><p> 28 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day. </p><p> 29 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/deu/28">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/deu/30">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
