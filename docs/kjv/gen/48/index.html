And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. </p><p> 10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them. </p><p> 11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed. </p><p> 12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. </p><p> 13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel&#39;s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel&#39;s right hand, and brought them near unto him. </p><p> 14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim&#39;s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh&#39;s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn. </p><p> 15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day, </p><p> 16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. </p><p> 17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father&#39;s hand, to remove it from Ephraim&#39;s head unto Manasseh&#39;s head. </p><p> 18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. </p><p> 19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations. </p><p> 20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. </p><p> 21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers. </p><p> 22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/47">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/49">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
