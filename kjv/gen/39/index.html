And Joseph was a goodly person, and well favoured. </p><p> 7 And it came to pass after these things, that his master&#39;s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me. </p><p> 8 But he refused, and said unto his master&#39;s wife, Behold, my master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand; </p><p> 9 There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? </p><p> 10 And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her. </p><p> 11 And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the house there within. </p><p> 12 And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out. </p><p> 13 And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, </p><p> 14 That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: </p><p> 15 And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got him out. </p><p> 16 And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home. </p><p> 17 And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me: </p><p> 18 And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled out. </p><p> 19 And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled. </p><p> 20 And Joseph&#39;s master took him, and put him into the prison, a place where the king&#39;s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison. </p><p> 21 But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison. </p><p> 22 And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph&#39;s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. </p><p> 23 The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which he did, the LORD made it to prosper. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/38">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/40">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
