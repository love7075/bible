If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? </p><p> 18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. </p><p> 19 And if they were all one member, where were the body? </p><p> 20 But now are they many members, yet but one body. </p><p> 21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. </p><p> 22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: </p><p> 23 And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. </p><p> 24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: </p><p> 25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. </p><p> 26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it. </p><p> 27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. </p><p> 28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues. </p><p> 29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? </p><p> 30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? </p><p> 31 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1co/11">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1co/13">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
