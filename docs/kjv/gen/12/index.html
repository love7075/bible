And the Canaanite was then in the land. </p><p> 7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him. </p><p> 8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD. </p><p> 9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south. </p><p> 10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land. </p><p> 11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon: </p><p> 12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive. </p><p> 13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee. </p><p> 14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair. </p><p> 15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh&#39;s house. </p><p> 16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels. </p><p> 17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram&#39;s wife. </p><p> 18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? </p><p> 19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way. </p><p> 20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/11">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/13">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
