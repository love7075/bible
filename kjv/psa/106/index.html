O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. </p><p> 2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise? </p><p> 3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times. </p><p> 4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation; </p><p> 5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance. </p><p> 6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly. </p><p> 7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea. </p><p> 8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name&#39;s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known. </p><p> 9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness. </p><p> 10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy. </p><p> 11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left. </p><p> 12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise. </p><p> 13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel: </p><p> 14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert. </p><p> 15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul. </p><p> 16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD. </p><p> 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram. </p><p> 18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked. </p><p> 19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image. </p><p> 20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. </p><p> 21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt; </p><p> 22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea. </p><p> 23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them. </p><p> 24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word: </p><p> 25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD. </p><p> 26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness: </p><p> 27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands. </p><p> 28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. </p><p> 29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them. </p><p> 30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed. </p><p> 31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore. </p><p> 32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes: </p><p> 33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips. </p><p> 34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them: </p><p> 35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works. </p><p> 36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them. </p><p> 37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils, </p><p> 38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood. </p><p> 39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions. </p><p> 40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance. </p><p> 41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them. </p><p> 42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand. </p><p> 43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity. </p><p> 44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry: </p><p> 45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies. </p><p> 46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives. </p><p> 47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. </p><p> 48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/psa/105">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/psa/107">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
