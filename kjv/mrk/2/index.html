And he arose and followed him. </p><p> 15 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him. </p><p> 16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners? </p><p> 17 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. </p><p> 18 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not? </p><p> 19 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. </p><p> 20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. </p><p> 21 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent is made worse. </p><p> 22 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles. </p><p> 23 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn. </p><p> 24 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful? </p><p> 25 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him? </p><p> 26 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him? </p><p> 27 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: </p><p> 28 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mrk/1">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mrk/3">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
