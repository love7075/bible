Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt. </p><p> 19 All that openeth the matrix is mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. </p><p> 20 But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou redeem him not, then shalt thou break his neck. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. </p><p> 21 Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest. </p><p> 22 And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year&#39;s end. </p><p> 23 Thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the LORD God, the God of Israel. </p><p> 24 For I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God thrice in the year. </p><p> 25 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning. </p><p> 26 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother&#39;s milk. </p><p> 27 And the LORD said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. </p><p> 28 And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. </p><p> 29 And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses&#39; hand, when he came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. </p><p> 30 And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him. </p><p> 31 And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. </p><p> 32 And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. </p><p> 33 And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. </p><p> 34 But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out, and spake unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded. </p><p> 35 And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses&#39; face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/exo/33">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/exo/35">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
