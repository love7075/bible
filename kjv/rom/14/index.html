Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand. </p><p> 5 One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. </p><p> 6 He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks. </p><p> 7 For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself. </p><p> 8 For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord&#39;s. </p><p> 9 For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living. </p><p> 10 But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. </p><p> 11 For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. </p><p> 12 So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. </p><p> 13 Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother&#39;s way. </p><p> 14 I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. </p><p> 15 But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. </p><p> 16 Let not then your good be evil spoken of: </p><p> 17 For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. </p><p> 18 For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men. </p><p> 19 Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another. </p><p> 20 For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. </p><p> 21 It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak. </p><p> 22 Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. </p><p> 23 And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/rom/13">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/rom/15">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
