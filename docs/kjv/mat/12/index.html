And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. </p><p> 11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? </p><p> 12 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days. </p><p> 13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other. </p><p> 14 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him. </p><p> 15 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; </p><p> 16 And charged them that they should not make him known: </p><p> 17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, </p><p> 18 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles. </p><p> 19 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. </p><p> 20 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory. </p><p> 21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust. </p><p> 22 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw. </p><p> 23 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of David? </p><p> 24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. </p><p> 25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: </p><p> 26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand? </p><p> 27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges. </p><p> 28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you. </p><p> 29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man&#39;s house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house. </p><p> 30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad. </p><p> 31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. </p><p> 32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. </p><p> 33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his fruit. </p><p> 34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. </p><p> 35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. </p><p> 36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. </p><p> 37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. </p><p> 38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee. </p><p> 39 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: </p><p> 40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale&#39;s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. </p><p> 41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here. </p><p> 42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here. </p><p> 43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. </p><p> 44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. </p><p> 45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. </p><p> 46 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him. </p><p> 47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee. </p><p> 48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? </p><p> 49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren! </p><p> 50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mat/11">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mat/13">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
