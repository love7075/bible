When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him. </p><p> 20 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD. </p><p> 21 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed&#39;s seed, saith the LORD, from henceforth and for ever. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/isa/58">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/isa/60">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
