And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. </p><p> 16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. </p><p> 17 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? </p><p> 18 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples. </p><p> 19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. </p><p> 20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. </p><p> 21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. </p><p> 22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? </p><p> 23 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. </p><p> 24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born. </p><p> 25 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said. </p><p> 26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. </p><p> 27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; </p><p> 28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. </p><p> 29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father&#39;s kingdom. </p><p> 30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. </p><p> 31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. </p><p> 32 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. </p><p> 33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. </p><p> 34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. </p><p> 35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. </p><p> 36 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. </p><p> 37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. </p><p> 38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me. </p><p> 39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. </p><p> 40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? </p><p> 41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. </p><p> 42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done. </p><p> 43 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. </p><p> 44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. </p><p> 45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. </p><p> 46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me. </p><p> 47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. </p><p> 48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. </p><p> 49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. </p><p> 50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him. </p><p> 51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest&#39;s, and smote off his ear. </p><p> 52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword. </p><p> 53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? </p><p> 54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? </p><p> 55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me. </p><p> 56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. </p><p> 57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. </p><p> 58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest&#39;s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. </p><p> 59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; </p><p> 60 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, </p><p> 61 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. </p><p> 62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? </p><p> 63 But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God. </p><p> 64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. </p><p> 65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. </p><p> 66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. </p><p> 67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, </p><p> 68 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee? </p><p> 69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee. </p><p> 70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. </p><p> 71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth. </p><p> 72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. </p><p> 73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. </p><p> 74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. </p><p> 75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mat/25">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mat/27">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
