And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out. </p><p> 30 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. </p><p> 31 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against thee. </p><p> 32 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee, and lie in wait in the field: </p><p> 33 And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion. </p><p> 34 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies. </p><p> 35 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait. </p><p> 36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men. </p><p> 37 And Gaal spake again and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim. </p><p> 38 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them. </p><p> 39 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech. </p><p> 40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate. </p><p> 41 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem. </p><p> 42 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech. </p><p> 43 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them. </p><p> 44 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew them. </p><p> 45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt. </p><p> 46 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith. </p><p> 47 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together. </p><p> 48 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done. </p><p> 49 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women. </p><p> 50 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it. </p><p> 51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower. </p><p> 52 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire. </p><p> 53 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech&#39;s head, and all to brake his skull. </p><p> 54 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died. </p><p> 55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place. </p><p> 56 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: </p><p> 57 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jdg/8">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jdg/10">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
