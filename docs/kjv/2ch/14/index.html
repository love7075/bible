In his days the land was quiet ten years. </p><p> 2 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God: </p><p> 3 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves: </p><p> 4 And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment. </p><p> 5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him. </p><p> 6 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest. </p><p> 7 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered. </p><p> 8 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour. </p><p> 9 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah. </p><p> 10 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah. </p><p> 11 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee. </p><p> 12 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled. </p><p> 13 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil. </p><p> 14 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them. </p><p> 15 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2ch/13">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2ch/15">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
