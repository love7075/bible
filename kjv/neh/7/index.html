And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein, </p><p> 6 These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city; </p><p> 7 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.

children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five. </p><p> 37 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one. </p><p> 38 The children of Senaah, three thousand nine hundred and thirty. </p><p> 39 The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy and three. </p><p> 40 The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two. </p><p> 41 The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and seven. </p><p> 42 The children of Harim, a thousand and seventeen. </p><p> 43 The Levites: the children of Jeshua, of Kadmiel, and of the children of Hodevah,

servants, were three hundred ninety and two. </p><p> 61 And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father&#39;s house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel. </p><p> 62 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two. </p><p> 63 And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name. </p><p> 64 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood. </p><p> 65 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim. </p><p> 66 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, </p><p> 67 Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women. </p><p> 68 Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred forty and five: </p><p> 69 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses. </p><p> 70 And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and thirty priests&#39; garments. </p><p> 71 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver. </p><p> 72 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests&#39; garments. </p><p> 73 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of Israel were in their cities. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/neh/6">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/neh/8">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
