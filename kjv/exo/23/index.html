In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard. </p><p> 12 Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest: that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed. </p><p> 13 And in all things that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. </p><p> 14 Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year. </p><p> 15 Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:) </p><p> 16 And the feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field. </p><p> 17 Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the LORD God. </p><p> 18 Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning. </p><p> 19 The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother&#39;s milk. </p><p> 20 Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. </p><p> 21 Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him. </p><p> 22 But if thou shalt indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries. </p><p> 23 For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off. </p><p> 24 Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images. </p><p> 25 And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. </p><p> 26 There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil. </p><p> 27 I will send my fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. </p><p> 28 And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. </p><p> 29 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee. </p><p> 30 By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land. </p><p> 31 And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert unto the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. </p><p> 32 Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods. </p><p> 33 They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me: for if thou serve their gods, it will surely be a snare unto thee. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/exo/22">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/exo/24">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
