The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away: </p><p> 25 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1pe/0">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1pe/2">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
