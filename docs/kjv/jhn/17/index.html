Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. </p><p> 12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled. </p><p> 13 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves. </p><p> 14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. </p><p> 15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil. </p><p> 16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. </p><p> 17 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. </p><p> 18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world. </p><p> 19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth. </p><p> 20 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word; </p><p> 21 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. </p><p> 22 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: </p><p> 23 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me. </p><p> 24 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world. </p><p> 25 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me. </p><p> 26 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/16">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/18">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
