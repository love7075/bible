Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man) </p><p> 6 God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world? </p><p> 7 For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner? </p><p> 8 And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just. </p><p> 9 What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin; </p><p> 10 As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: </p><p> 11 There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. </p><p> 12 They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one. </p><p> 13 Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips: </p><p> 14 Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: </p><p> 15 Their feet are swift to shed blood: </p><p> 16 Destruction and misery are in their ways: </p><p> 17 And the way of peace have they not known: </p><p> 18 There is no fear of God before their eyes. </p><p> 19 Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God. </p><p> 20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin. </p><p> 21 But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; </p><p> 22 Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference: </p><p> 23 For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; </p><p> 24 Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: </p><p> 25 Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; </p><p> 26 To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus. </p><p> 27 Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith. </p><p> 28 Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. </p><p> 29 Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also: </p><p> 30 Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. </p><p> 31 Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/rom/2">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/rom/4">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
