He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. </p><p> 8 The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? </p><p> 9 Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. </p><p> 10 Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? </p><p> 11 He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight. </p><p> 12 Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. </p><p> 13 They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. </p><p> 14 And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes. </p><p> 15 Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. </p><p> 16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. </p><p> 17 They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. </p><p> 18 But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. </p><p> 19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? </p><p> 20 His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: </p><p> 21 But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. </p><p> 22 These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. </p><p> 23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. </p><p> 24 Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. </p><p> 25 He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. </p><p> 26 Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? </p><p> 27 He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? </p><p> 28 Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses&#39; disciples. </p><p> 29 We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. </p><p> 30 The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. </p><p> 31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. </p><p> 32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. </p><p> 33 If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. </p><p> 34 They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. </p><p> 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God? </p><p> 36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? </p><p> 37 And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee. </p><p> 38 And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. </p><p> 39 And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. </p><p> 40 And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? </p><p> 41 Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/8">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/10">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
