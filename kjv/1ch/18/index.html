Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. </p><p> 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. </p><p> 8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass. </p><p> 9 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah; </p><p> 10 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass. </p><p> 11 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek. </p><p> 12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand. </p><p> 13 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David&#39;s servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. </p><p> 14 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people. </p><p> 15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder. </p><p> 16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe; </p><p> 17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1ch/17">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1ch/19">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
