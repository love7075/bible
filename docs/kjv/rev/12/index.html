Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. </p><p> 13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. </p><p> 14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. </p><p> 15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. </p><p> 16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. </p><p> 17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/rev/11">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/rev/13">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
