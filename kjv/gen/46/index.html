And he said, Here am I. </p><p> 3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation: </p><p> 4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes. </p><p> 5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him. </p><p> 6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his seed with him: </p><p> 7 His sons, and his sons&#39; sons with him, his daughters, and his sons&#39; daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt. </p><p> 8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob&#39;s firstborn. </p><p> 9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and Carmi. </p><p> 10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman. </p><p> 11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. </p><p> 12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez, and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul. </p><p> 13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and Shimron. </p><p> 14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel. </p><p> 15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three. </p><p> 16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri, and Arodi, and Areli. </p><p> 17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and Malchiel. </p><p> 18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls. </p><p> 19 The sons of Rachel Jacob&#39;s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin. </p><p> 20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto him. </p><p> 21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel, Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard. </p><p> 22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the souls were fourteen. </p><p> 23 And the sons of Dan; Hushim. </p><p> 24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shillem. </p><p> 25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven. </p><p> 26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob&#39;s sons&#39; wives, all the souls were threescore and six; </p><p> 27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten. </p><p> 28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. </p><p> 29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while. </p><p> 30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen thy face, because thou art yet alive. </p><p> 31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father&#39;s house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my father&#39;s house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me; </p><p> 32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have. </p><p> 33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and shall say, What is your occupation? </p><p> 34 That ye shall say, Thy servants&#39; trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/45">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/47">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
