And he divided unto them his living. </p><p> 13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. </p><p> 14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. </p><p> 15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. </p><p> 16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. </p><p> 17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father&#39;s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! </p><p> 18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, </p><p> 19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. </p><p> 20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. </p><p> 21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. </p><p> 22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: </p><p> 23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: </p><p> 24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. </p><p> 25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. </p><p> 26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. </p><p> 27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. </p><p> 28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him. </p><p> 29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: </p><p> 30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. </p><p> 31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. </p><p> 32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/luk/14">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/luk/16">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
