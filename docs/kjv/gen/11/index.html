And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter. </p><p> 4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth. </p><p> 5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded. </p><p> 6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do. </p><p> 7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another&#39;s speech. </p><p> 8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city. </p><p> 9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth. </p><p> 10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood: </p><p> 11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. </p><p> 12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah: </p><p> 13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. </p><p> 14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber: </p><p> 15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. </p><p> 16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: </p><p> 17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. </p><p> 18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: </p><p> 19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. </p><p> 20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: </p><p> 21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. </p><p> 22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: </p><p> 23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. </p><p> 24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: </p><p> 25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. </p><p> 26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. </p><p> 27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot. </p><p> 28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. </p><p> 29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram&#39;s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor&#39;s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. </p><p> 30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child. </p><p> 31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son&#39;s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram&#39;s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there. </p><p> 32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/10">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/12">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
