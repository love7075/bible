Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren? </p><p> 6 But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers. </p><p> 7 Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? </p><p> 8 Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren. </p><p> 9 Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, </p><p> 10 Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. </p><p> 11 And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. </p><p> 12 All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. </p><p> 13 Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. </p><p> 14 And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power. </p><p> 15 Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. </p><p> 16 What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. </p><p> 17 But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit. </p><p> 18 Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body. </p><p> 19 What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own? </p><p> 20 For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God&#39;s. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1co/5">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1co/7">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
