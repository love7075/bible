Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel? </p><p> 14 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, </p><p> 15 Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel wholly, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the LORD: unto us is this land given in possession. </p><p> 16 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. </p><p> 17 Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. </p><p> 18 And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. </p><p> 19 And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them an heart of flesh: </p><p> 20 That they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. </p><p> 21 But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord GOD. </p><p> 22 Then did the cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above. </p><p> 23 And the glory of the LORD went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city. </p><p> 24 Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me. </p><p> 25 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had shewed me. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/ezk/10">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/ezk/12">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
