Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. </p><p> 7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, </p><p> 8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. </p><p> 9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. </p><p> 10 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand: </p><p> 11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man. </p><p> 12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying? </p><p> 13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up. </p><p> 14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch. </p><p> 15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable. </p><p> 16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding? </p><p> 17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught? </p><p> 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man. </p><p> 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: </p><p> 20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man. </p><p> 21 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. </p><p> 22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. </p><p> 23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. </p><p> 24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. </p><p> 25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. </p><p> 26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children&#39;s bread, and to cast it to dogs. </p><p> 27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters&#39; table. </p><p> 28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour. </p><p> 29 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there. </p><p> 30 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus&#39; feet; and he healed them: </p><p> 31 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel. </p><p> 32 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way. </p><p> 33 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude? </p><p> 34 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes. </p><p> 35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground. </p><p> 36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude. </p><p> 37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full. </p><p> 38 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children. </p><p> 39 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mat/14">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mat/16">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
