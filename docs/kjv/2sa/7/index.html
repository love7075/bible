Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house. </p><p> 12 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. </p><p> 13 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. </p><p> 14 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men: </p><p> 15 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee. </p><p> 16 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever. </p><p> 17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. </p><p> 18 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? </p><p> 19 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant&#39;s house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD? </p><p> 20 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant. </p><p> 21 For thy word&#39;s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them. </p><p> 22 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. </p><p> 23 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods? </p><p> 24 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God. </p><p> 25 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said. </p><p> 26 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee. </p><p> 27 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee. </p><p> 28 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: </p><p> 29 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2sa/6">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2sa/8">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
