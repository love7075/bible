Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold. </p><p> 33 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground. </p><p> 34 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt. </p><p> 35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. </p><p> 36 He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. </p><p> 37 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear. </p><p> 38 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us: </p><p> 39 To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt, </p><p> 40 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him. </p><p> 41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. </p><p> 42 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness? </p><p> 43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon. </p><p> 44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen. </p><p> 45 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; </p><p> 46 Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. </p><p> 47 But Solomon built him an house. </p><p> 48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, </p><p> 49 Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? </p><p> 50 Hath not my hand made all these things? </p><p> 51 Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. </p><p> 52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: </p><p> 53 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it. </p><p> 54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. </p><p> 55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God, </p><p> 56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. </p><p> 57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, </p><p> 58 And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man&#39;s feet, whose name was Saul. </p><p> 59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. </p><p> 60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/act/6">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/act/8">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
