So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things. </p><p> 17 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth. </p><p> 18 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever. </p><p> 19 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet; </p><p> 20 And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows. </p><p> 21 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; </p><p> 22 Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom. </p><p> 23 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces. </p><p> 24 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings. </p><p> 25 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time. </p><p> 26 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end. </p><p> 27 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him. </p><p> 28 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/dan/6">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/dan/8">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
