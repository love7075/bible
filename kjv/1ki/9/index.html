And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day. </p><p> 14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold. </p><p> 15 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. </p><p> 16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon&#39;s wife. </p><p> 17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, </p><p> 18 And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, </p><p> 19 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. </p><p> 20 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, </p><p> 21 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day. </p><p> 22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen. </p><p> 23 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon&#39;s work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work. </p><p> 24 But Pharaoh&#39;s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo. </p><p> 25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished the house. </p><p> 26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom. </p><p> 27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. </p><p> 28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1ki/8">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1ki/10">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
