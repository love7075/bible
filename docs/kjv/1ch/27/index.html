These were the princes of the tribes of Israel. </p><p> 23 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel like to the stars of the heavens. </p><p> 24 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David. </p><p> 25 And over the king&#39;s treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah: </p><p> 26 And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub: </p><p> 27 And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite: </p><p> 28 And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash: </p><p> 29 And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai: </p><p> 30 Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: </p><p> 31 And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the rulers of the substance which was king David&#39;s. </p><p> 32 Also Jonathan David&#39;s uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king&#39;s sons: </p><p> 33 And Ahithophel was the king&#39;s counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the king&#39;s companion: </p><p> 34 And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the king&#39;s army was Joab. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1ch/26">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1ch/28">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
