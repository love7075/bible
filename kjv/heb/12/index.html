For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven: </p><p> 26 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven. </p><p> 27 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. </p><p> 28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear: </p><p> 29 For our God is a consuming fire. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/heb/11">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/heb/13">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
