Lo, certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain. </p><p> 9 The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them? </p><p> 10 Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely. </p><p> 11 For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. </p><p> 12 Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD. </p><p> 13 I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them. </p><p> 14 Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD. </p><p> 15 We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble! </p><p> 16 The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein. </p><p> 17 For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD. </p><p> 18 When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me. </p><p> 19 Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities? </p><p> 20 The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. </p><p> 21 For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me. </p><p> 22 Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered? </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jer/7">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jer/9">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
