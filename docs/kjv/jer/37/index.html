But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. </p><p> 15 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison. </p><p> 16 When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days; </p><p> 17 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon. </p><p> 18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? </p><p> 19 Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land? </p><p> 20 Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there. </p><p> 21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers&#39; street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jer/36">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jer/38">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
