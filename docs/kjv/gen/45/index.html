And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. </p><p> 2 And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard. </p><p> 3 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence. </p><p> 4 And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt. </p><p> 5 Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. </p><p> 6 For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet there are five years, in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest. </p><p> 7 And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. </p><p> 8 So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt. </p><p> 9 Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: </p><p> 10 And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children&#39;s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast: </p><p> 11 And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast, come to poverty. </p><p> 12 And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. </p><p> 13 And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. </p><p> 14 And he fell upon his brother Benjamin&#39;s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. </p><p> 15 Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him. </p><p> 16 And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh&#39;s house, saying, Joseph&#39;s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants. </p><p> 17 And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan; </p><p> 18 And take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land. </p><p> 19 Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come. </p><p> 20 Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours. </p><p> 21 And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way. </p><p> 22 To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment. </p><p> 23 And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way. </p><p> 24 So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way. </p><p> 25 And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father, </p><p> 26 And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob&#39;s heart fainted, for he believed them not. </p><p> 27 And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived: </p><p> 28 And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/44">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/46">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
