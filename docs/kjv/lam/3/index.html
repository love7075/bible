</p><p> 38 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? </p><p> 39 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? </p><p> 40 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. </p><p> 41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. </p><p> 42 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. </p><p> 43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. </p><p> 44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through. </p><p> 45 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. </p><p> 46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. </p><p> 47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. </p><p> 48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. </p><p> 49 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, </p><p> 50 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. </p><p> 51 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. </p><p> 52 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. </p><p> 53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. </p><p> 54 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off. </p><p> 55 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. </p><p> 56 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. </p><p> 57 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. </p><p> 58 O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. </p><p> 59 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. </p><p> 60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me. </p><p> 61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me; </p><p> 62 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. </p><p> 63 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick. </p><p> 64 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. </p><p> 65 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. </p><p> 66 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/lam/2">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/lam/4">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
