And all the people shall answer and say, Amen. </p><p> 16 Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen. </p><p> 17 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour&#39;s landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen. </p><p> 18 Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen. </p><p> 19 Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen. </p><p> 20 Cursed be he that lieth with his father&#39;s wife; because he uncovereth his father&#39;s skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen. </p><p> 21 Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen. </p><p> 22 Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen. </p><p> 23 Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the people shall say, Amen. </p><p> 24 Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen. </p><p> 25 Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen. </p><p> 26 Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/deu/26">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/deu/28">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
