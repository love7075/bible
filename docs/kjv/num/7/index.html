</p><p> 2 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were numbered, offered: </p><p> 3 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle. </p><p> 4 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, </p><p> 5 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to every man according to his service. </p><p> 6 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites. </p><p> 7 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their service: </p><p> 8 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. </p><p> 9 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders. </p><p> 10 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering before the altar. </p><p> 11 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering, each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar. </p><p> 12 And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah: </p><p> 13 And his offering was one silver charger, the weight thereof was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary;
