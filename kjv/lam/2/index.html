Shall the women eat their fruit, and children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord? </p><p> 21 The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied. </p><p> 22 Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about, so that in the day of the LORD&#39;s anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/lam/1">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/lam/3">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
