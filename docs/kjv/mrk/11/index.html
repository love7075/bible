And his disciples heard it. </p><p> 15 And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves; </p><p> 16 And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple. </p><p> 17 And he taught, saying unto them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves. </p><p> 18 And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine. </p><p> 19 And when even was come, he went out of the city. </p><p> 20 And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. </p><p> 21 And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. </p><p> 22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God. </p><p> 23 For verily I say unto you, That whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith. </p><p> 24 Therefore I say unto you, What things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them. </p><p> 25 And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. </p><p> 26 But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses. </p><p> 27 And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders, </p><p> 28 And say unto him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things? </p><p> 29 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. </p><p> 30 The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me. </p><p> 31 And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him? </p><p> 32 But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed. </p><p> 33 And they answered and said unto Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mrk/10">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mrk/12">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
