Amen. </p><p> 26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: </p><p> 27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. </p><p> 28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient; </p><p> 29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers, </p><p> 30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, </p><p> 31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful: </p><p> 32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/rom/0">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/rom/2">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
