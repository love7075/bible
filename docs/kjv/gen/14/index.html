And he gave him tithes of all. </p><p> 21 And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons, and take the goods to thyself. </p><p> 22 And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth, </p><p> 23 That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou shouldest say, I have made Abram rich: </p><p> 24 Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their portion. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/13">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/15">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
