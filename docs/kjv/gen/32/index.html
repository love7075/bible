For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of me. </p><p> 21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that night in the company. </p><p> 22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok. </p><p> 23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over that he had. </p><p> 24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. </p><p> 25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob&#39;s thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. </p><p> 26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me. </p><p> 27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. </p><p> 28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed. </p><p> 29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there. </p><p> 30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved. </p><p> 31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he halted upon his thigh. </p><p> 32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob&#39;s thigh in the sinew that shrank. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/31">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/33">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
