</p><p> 18 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty. </p><p> 19 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the altar that sanctifieth the gift? </p><p> 20 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon. </p><p> 21 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him that dwelleth therein. </p><p> 22 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of God, and by him that sitteth thereon. </p><p> 23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone. </p><p> 24 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel. </p><p> 25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess. </p><p> 26 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also. </p><p> 27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men&#39;s bones, and of all uncleanness. </p><p> 28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity. </p><p> 29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous, </p><p> 30 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets. </p><p> 31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets. </p><p> 32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. </p><p> 33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell? </p><p> 34 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify; and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute them from city to city: </p><p> 35 That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar. </p><p> 36 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation. </p><p> 37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! </p><p> 38 Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. </p><p> 39 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mat/22">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mat/24">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
