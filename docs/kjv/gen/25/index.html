And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim. </p><p> 4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah. </p><p> 5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac. </p><p> 6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country. </p><p> 7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham&#39;s life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. </p><p> 8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people. </p><p> 9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre; </p><p> 10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife. </p><p> 11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. </p><p> 12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham&#39;s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah&#39;s handmaid, bare unto Abraham: </p><p> 13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, </p><p> 14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, </p><p> 15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah: </p><p> 16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations. </p><p> 17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people. </p><p> 18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren. </p><p> 19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham&#39;s son: Abraham begat Isaac: </p><p> 20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian. </p><p> 21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived. </p><p> 22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD. </p><p> 23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger. </p><p> 24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. </p><p> 25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. </p><p> 26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau&#39;s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. </p><p> 27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. </p><p> 28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob. </p><p> 29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint: </p><p> 30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom. </p><p> 31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright. </p><p> 32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me? </p><p> 33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. </p><p> 34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/24">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/26">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
