Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return? </p><p> 8 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings. </p><p> 9 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this whole nation. </p><p> 10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. </p><p> 11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of hosts. </p><p> 12 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts. </p><p> 13 Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, What have we spoken so much against thee? </p><p> 14 Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of hosts? </p><p> 15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even delivered. </p><p> 16 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought upon his name. </p><p> 17 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him. </p><p> 18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mal/2">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mal/4">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
