And Ziba said, The asses be for the king&#39;s household to ride on; and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat; and the wine, that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink. </p><p> 3 And the king said, And where is thy master&#39;s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abideth at Jerusalem: for he said, To day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father. </p><p> 4 Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king. </p><p> 5 And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came. </p><p> 6 And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left. </p><p> 7 And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial: </p><p> 8 The LORD hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast reigned; and the LORD hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of Absalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man. </p><p> 9 Then said Abishai the son of Zeruiah unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head. </p><p> 10 And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? so let him curse, because the LORD hath said unto him, Curse David. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so? </p><p> 11 And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, Behold, my son, which came forth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now may this Benjamite do it? let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD hath bidden him. </p><p> 12 It may be that the LORD will look on mine affliction, and that the LORD will requite me good for his cursing this day. </p><p> 13 And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hill&#39;s side over against him, and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust. </p><p> 14 And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there. </p><p> 15 And Absalom, and all the people the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. </p><p> 16 And it came to pass, when Hushai the Archite, David&#39;s friend, was come unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, God save the king, God save the king. </p><p> 17 And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not with thy friend? </p><p> 18 And Hushai said unto Absalom, Nay; but whom the LORD, and this people, and all the men of Israel, choose, his will I be, and with him will I abide. </p><p> 19 And again, whom should I serve? should I not serve in the presence of his son? as I have served in thy father&#39;s presence, so will I be in thy presence. </p><p> 20 Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do. </p><p> 21 And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father&#39;s concubines, which he hath left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father: then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong. </p><p> 22 So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father&#39;s concubines in the sight of all Israel. </p><p> 23 And the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God: so was all the counsel of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2sa/15">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2sa/17">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
