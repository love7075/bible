The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? </p><p> 17 For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. </p><p> 18 Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? </p><p> 19 What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing? </p><p> 20 But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils. </p><p> 21 Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord&#39;s table, and of the table of devils. </p><p> 22 Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he? </p><p> 23 All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not. </p><p> 24 Let no man seek his own, but every man another&#39;s wealth. </p><p> 25 Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake: </p><p> 26 For the earth is the Lord&#39;s, and the fulness thereof. </p><p> 27 If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake. </p><p> 28 But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord&#39;s, and the fulness thereof: </p><p> 29 Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man&#39;s conscience? </p><p> 30 For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? </p><p> 31 Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. </p><p> 32 Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God: </p><p> 33 Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1co/9">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1co/11">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
