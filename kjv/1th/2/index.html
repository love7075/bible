Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? </p><p> 20 For ye are our glory and joy. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1th/1">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1th/3">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
