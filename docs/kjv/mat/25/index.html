or thirsty, and gave thee drink? </p><p> 38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? </p><p> 39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? </p><p> 40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me. </p><p> 41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels: </p><p> 42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: </p><p> 43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. </p><p> 44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? </p><p> 45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me. </p><p> 46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mat/24">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mat/26">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
