In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter. </p><p> 12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you. </p><p> 13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all. </p><p> 14 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth. </p><p> 15 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him. </p><p> 16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2co/6">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2co/8">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
