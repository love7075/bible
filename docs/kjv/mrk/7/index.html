And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. </p><p> 5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? </p><p> 6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. </p><p> 7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. </p><p> 8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do. </p><p> 9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition. </p><p> 10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death: </p><p> 11 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free. </p><p> 12 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother; </p><p> 13 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye. </p><p> 14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand: </p><p> 15 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man. </p><p> 16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. </p><p> 17 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. </p><p> 18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; </p><p> 19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? </p><p> 20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. </p><p> 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, </p><p> 22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: </p><p> 23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man. </p><p> 24 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid. </p><p> 25 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: </p><p> 26 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. </p><p> 27 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children&#39;s bread, and to cast it unto the dogs. </p><p> 28 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children&#39;s crumbs. </p><p> 29 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter. </p><p> 30 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed. </p><p> 31 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. </p><p> 32 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. </p><p> 33 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; </p><p> 34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. </p><p> 35 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. </p><p> 36 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; </p><p> 37 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mrk/6">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mrk/8">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
