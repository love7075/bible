Doth God take care for oxen? </p><p> 10 Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope. </p><p> 11 If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things? </p><p> 12 If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ. </p><p> 13 Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar? </p><p> 14 Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel. </p><p> 15 But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void. </p><p> 16 For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel! </p><p> 17 For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me. </p><p> 18 What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel. </p><p> 19 For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more. </p><p> 20 And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law; </p><p> 21 To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law. </p><p> 22 To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. </p><p> 23 And this I do for the gospel&#39;s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you. </p><p> 24 Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. </p><p> 25 And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible. </p><p> 26 I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: </p><p> 27 But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1co/8">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1co/10">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
