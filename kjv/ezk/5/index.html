I the LORD have spoken it. </p><p> 16 When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread: </p><p> 17 So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/ezk/4">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/ezk/6">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
