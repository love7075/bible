or who is a rock save our God? </p><p> 32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect. </p><p> 33 He maketh my feet like hinds&#39; feet, and setteth me upon my high places. </p><p> 34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms. </p><p> 35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great. </p><p> 36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip. </p><p> 37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed. </p><p> 38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet. </p><p> 39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me. </p><p> 40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me. </p><p> 41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not. </p><p> 42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets. </p><p> 43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me. </p><p> 44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me. </p><p> 45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places. </p><p> 46 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted. </p><p> 47 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me. </p><p> 48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man. </p><p> 49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name. </p><p> 50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/psa/17">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/psa/19">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
