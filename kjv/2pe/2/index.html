Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities. </p><p> 11 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. </p><p> 12 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption; </p><p> 13 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you; </p><p> 14 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children: </p><p> 15 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; </p><p> 16 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with man&#39;s voice forbad the madness of the prophet. </p><p> 17 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever. </p><p> 18 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error. </p><p> 19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage. </p><p> 20 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. </p><p> 21 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them. </p><p> 22 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2pe/1">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2pe/3">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
