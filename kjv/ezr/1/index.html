All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/ezr/0">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/ezr/2">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
