</p><p> 33 When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou filledst many people; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise. </p><p> 34 In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall. </p><p> 35 All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance. </p><p> 36 The merchants among the people shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt be any more. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/ezk/26">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/ezk/28">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
