And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. </p><p> 16 This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. </p><p> 17 And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. </p><p> 18 And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. </p><p> 19 And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. </p><p> 20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them. </p><p> 21 And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. </p><p> 22 And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. </p><p> 23 And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. </p><p> 24 And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. </p><p> 25 And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field. </p><p> 26 Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. </p><p> 27 And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. </p><p> 28 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? </p><p> 29 See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. </p><p> 30 So the people rested on the seventh day. </p><p> 31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. </p><p> 32 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. </p><p> 33 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. </p><p> 34 As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. </p><p> 35 And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan. </p><p> 36 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/exo/15">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/exo/17">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
