Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. </p><p> 6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear. </p><p> 7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, </p><p> 8 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father&#39;s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen. </p><p> 9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company. </p><p> 10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days. </p><p> 11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan. </p><p> 12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them: </p><p> 13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre. </p><p> 14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father. </p><p> 15 And when Joseph&#39;s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him. </p><p> 16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, </p><p> 17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him. </p><p> 18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants. </p><p> 19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God? </p><p> 20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive. </p><p> 21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. </p><p> 22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father&#39;s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. </p><p> 23 And Joseph saw Ephraim&#39;s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph&#39;s knees. </p><p> 24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. </p><p> 25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence. </p><p> 26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/49">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/exo/1">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
