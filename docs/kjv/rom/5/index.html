For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. </p><p> 16 And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification. </p><p> 17 For if by one man&#39;s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.) </p><p> 18 Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life. </p><p> 19 For as by one man&#39;s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. </p><p> 20 Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound: </p><p> 21 That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/rom/4">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/rom/6">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
