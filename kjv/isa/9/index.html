The zeal of the LORD of hosts will perform this. </p><p> 8 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. </p><p> 9 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart, </p><p> 10 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars. </p><p> 11 Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together; </p><p> 12 The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </p><p> 13 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the LORD of hosts. </p><p> 14 Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush, in one day. </p><p> 15 The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. </p><p> 16 For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed. </p><p> 17 Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </p><p> 18 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke. </p><p> 19 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall spare his brother. </p><p> 20 And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm: </p><p> 21 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/isa/8">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/isa/10">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
