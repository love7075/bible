If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. </p><p> 5 For neither did his brethren believe in him. </p><p> 6 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready. </p><p> 7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. </p><p> 8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come. </p><p> 9 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee. </p><p> 10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. </p><p> 11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? </p><p> 12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. </p><p> 13 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. </p><p> 14 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. </p><p> 15 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? </p><p> 16 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me. </p><p> 17 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. </p><p> 18 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </p><p> 19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? </p><p> 20 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? </p><p> 21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel. </p><p> 22 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. </p><p> 23 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? </p><p> 24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. </p><p> 25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? </p><p> 26 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? </p><p> 27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. </p><p> 28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not. </p><p> 29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. </p><p> 30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. </p><p> 31 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? </p><p> 32 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. </p><p> 33 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me. </p><p> 34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. </p><p> 35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? </p><p> 36 What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come? </p><p> 37 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. </p><p> 38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. </p><p> 39 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.) </p><p> 40 Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. </p><p> 41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? </p><p> 42 Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? </p><p> 43 So there was a division among the people because of him. </p><p> 44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. </p><p> 45 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? </p><p> 46 The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. </p><p> 47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? </p><p> 48 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? </p><p> 49 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. </p><p> 50 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,) </p><p> 51 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? </p><p> 52 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. </p><p> 53 And every man went unto his own house. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/6">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/8">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
