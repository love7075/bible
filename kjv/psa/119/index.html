for I have kept thy testimonies. </p><p> 23 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes. </p><p> 24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors. </p><p> 25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word. </p><p> 26 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes. </p><p> 27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works. </p><p> 28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word. </p><p> 29 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously. </p><p> 30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me. </p><p> 31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame. </p><p> 32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart. </p><p> 33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end. </p><p> 34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart. </p><p> 35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight. </p><p> 36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. </p><p> 37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way. </p><p> 38 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear. </p><p> 39 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good. </p><p> 40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness. </p><p> 41 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word. </p><p> 42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word. </p><p> 43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments. </p><p> 44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever. </p><p> 45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts. </p><p> 46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed. </p><p> 47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved. </p><p> 48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes. </p><p> 49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope. </p><p> 50 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me. </p><p> 51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law. </p><p> 52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself. </p><p> 53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law. </p><p> 54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage. </p><p> 55 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law. </p><p> 56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts. </p><p> 57 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words. </p><p> 58 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word. </p><p> 59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies. </p><p> 60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments. </p><p> 61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law. </p><p> 62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments. </p><p> 63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts. </p><p> 64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes. </p><p> 65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word. </p><p> 66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments. </p><p> 67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word. </p><p> 68 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes. </p><p> 69 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart. </p><p> 70 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law. </p><p> 71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes. </p><p> 72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver. </p><p> 73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments. </p><p> 74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word. </p><p> 75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me. </p><p> 76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant. </p><p> 77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight. </p><p> 78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts. </p><p> 79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies. </p><p> 80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed. </p><p> 81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word. </p><p> 82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me? </p><p> 83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes. </p><p> 84 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? </p><p> 85 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law. </p><p> 86 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me. </p><p> 87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts. </p><p> 88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth. </p><p> 89 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven. </p><p> 90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth. </p><p> 91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants. </p><p> 92 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction. </p><p> 93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me. </p><p> 94 I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts. </p><p> 95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies. </p><p> 96 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad. </p><p> 97 O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day. </p><p> 98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me. </p><p> 99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation. </p><p> 100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts. </p><p> 101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word. </p><p> 102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me. </p><p> 103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth! </p><p> 104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way. </p><p> 105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. </p><p> 106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments. </p><p> 107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word. </p><p> 108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments. </p><p> 109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law. </p><p> 110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts. </p><p> 111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart. </p><p> 112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end. </p><p> 113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love. </p><p> 114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word. </p><p> 115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God. </p><p> 116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope. </p><p> 117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually. </p><p> 118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood. </p><p> 119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies. </p><p> 120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments. </p><p> 121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors. </p><p> 122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me. </p><p> 123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness. </p><p> 124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes. </p><p> 125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies. </p><p> 126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law. </p><p> 127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold. </p><p> 128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way. </p><p> 129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep them. </p><p> 130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. </p><p> 131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments. </p><p> 132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. </p><p> 133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have dominion over me. </p><p> 134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy precepts. </p><p> 135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes. </p><p> 136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law. </p><p> 137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments. </p><p> 138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful. </p><p> 139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words. </p><p> 140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it. </p><p> 141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts. </p><p> 142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth. </p><p> 143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy commandments are my delights. </p><p> 144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me understanding, and I shall live. </p><p> 145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy statutes. </p><p> 146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies. </p><p> 147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in thy word. </p><p> 148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word. </p><p> 149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD, quicken me according to thy judgment. </p><p> 150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from thy law. </p><p> 151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth. </p><p> 152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever. </p><p> 153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget thy law. </p><p> 154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy word. </p><p> 155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy statutes. </p><p> 156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to thy judgments. </p><p> 157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies. </p><p> 158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word. </p><p> 159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD, according to thy lovingkindness. </p><p> 160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever. </p><p> 161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy word. </p><p> 162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil. </p><p> 163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love. </p><p> 164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments. </p><p> 165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them. </p><p> 166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments. </p><p> 167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly. </p><p> 168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways are before thee. </p><p> 169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me understanding according to thy word. </p><p> 170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to thy word. </p><p> 171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes. </p><p> 172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments are righteousness. </p><p> 173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts. </p><p> 174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight. </p><p> 175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me. </p><p> 176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/psa/118">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/psa/120">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
