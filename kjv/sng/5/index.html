I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? </p><p> 4 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him. </p><p> 5 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock. </p><p> 6 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. </p><p> 7 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. </p><p> 8 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love. </p><p> 9 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us? </p><p> 10 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand. </p><p> 11 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven. </p><p> 12 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set. </p><p> 13 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. </p><p> 14 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires. </p><p> 15 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. </p><p> 16 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/sng/4">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/sng/6">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
