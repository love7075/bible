And he said, I am. </p><p> 12 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him? </p><p> 13 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware. </p><p> 14 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe. </p><p> 15 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee. </p><p> 16 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD. </p><p> 17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour? </p><p> 18 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret? </p><p> 19 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on. </p><p> 20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground. </p><p> 21 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD. </p><p> 22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. </p><p> 23 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these. </p><p> 24 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him. </p><p> 25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jdg/12">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jdg/14">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
