And he said, Behold the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering? </p><p> 8 And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering: so they went both of them together. </p><p> 9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood. </p><p> 10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son. </p><p> 11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I. </p><p> 12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me. </p><p> 13 And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son. </p><p> 14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be seen. </p><p> 15 And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, </p><p> 16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: </p><p> 17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; </p><p> 18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice. </p><p> 19 So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba. </p><p> 20 And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children unto thy brother Nahor; </p><p> 21 Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, </p><p> 22 And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel. </p><p> 23 And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to Nahor, Abraham&#39;s brother. </p><p> 24 And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah, and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/21">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/23">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
