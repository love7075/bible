And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it. </p><p> 3 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. </p><p> 4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. </p><p> 5 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled. </p><p> 6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. </p><p> 7 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. </p><p> 8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. </p><p> 9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? </p><p> 10 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. </p><p> 11 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. </p><p> 12 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? </p><p> 13 And they cried out again, Crucify him. </p><p> 14 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. </p><p> 15 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. </p><p> 16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. </p><p> 17 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head, </p><p> 18 And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! </p><p> 19 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. </p><p> 20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. </p><p> 21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. </p><p> 22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. </p><p> 23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. </p><p> 24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. </p><p> 25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. </p><p> 26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. </p><p> 27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. </p><p> 28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. </p><p> 29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, </p><p> 30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross. </p><p> 31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. </p><p> 32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him. </p><p> 33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. </p><p> 34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? </p><p> 35 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. </p><p> 36 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. </p><p> 37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. </p><p> 38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. </p><p> 39 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. </p><p> 40 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; </p><p> 41 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem. </p><p> 42 And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, </p><p> 43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus. </p><p> 44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. </p><p> 45 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. </p><p> 46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. </p><p> 47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mrk/14">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mrk/16">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
