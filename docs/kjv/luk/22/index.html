And they said, Nothing. </p><p> 36 Then said he unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. </p><p> 37 For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end. </p><p> 38 And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough. </p><p> 39 And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. </p><p> 40 And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation. </p><p> 41 And he was withdrawn from them about a stone&#39;s cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, </p><p> 42 Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done. </p><p> 43 And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. </p><p> 44 And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. </p><p> 45 And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, </p><p> 46 And said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. </p><p> 47 And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. </p><p> 48 But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss? </p><p> 49 When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? </p><p> 50 And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. </p><p> 51 And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him. </p><p> 52 Then Jesus said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? </p><p> 53 When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. </p><p> 54 Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest&#39;s house. And Peter followed afar off. </p><p> 55 And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, Peter sat down among them. </p><p> 56 But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. </p><p> 57 And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. </p><p> 58 And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not. </p><p> 59 And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. </p><p> 60 And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. </p><p> 61 And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. </p><p> 62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly. </p><p> 63 And the men that held Jesus mocked him, and smote him. </p><p> 64 And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? </p><p> 65 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him. </p><p> 66 And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, </p><p> 67 Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: </p><p> 68 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. </p><p> 69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. </p><p> 70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am. </p><p> 71 And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/luk/21">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/luk/23">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
