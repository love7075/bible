And Samuel prayed unto the LORD. </p><p> 7 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. </p><p> 8 According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee. </p><p> 9 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. </p><p> 10 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that asked of him a king. </p><p> 11 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his chariots. </p><p> 12 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his chariots. </p><p> 13 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be cooks, and to be bakers. </p><p> 14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants. </p><p> 15 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants. </p><p> 16 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. </p><p> 17 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his servants. </p><p> 18 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day. </p><p> 19 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us; </p><p> 20 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles. </p><p> 21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the LORD. </p><p> 22 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man unto his city. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1sa/7">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1sa/9">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
