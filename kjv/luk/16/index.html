And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. </p><p> 7 Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. </p><p> 8 And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. </p><p> 9 And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. </p><p> 10 He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. </p><p> 11 If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? </p><p> 12 And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man&#39;s, who shall give you that which is your own? </p><p> 13 No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. </p><p> 14 And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. </p><p> 15 And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. </p><p> 16 The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. </p><p> 17 And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. </p><p> 18 Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery. </p><p> 19 There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: </p><p> 20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, </p><p> 21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man&#39;s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. </p><p> 22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham&#39;s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; </p><p> 23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. </p><p> 24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. </p><p> 25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. </p><p> 26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. </p><p> 27 Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father&#39;s house: </p><p> 28 For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. </p><p> 29 Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. </p><p> 30 And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. </p><p> 31 And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/luk/15">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/luk/17">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
