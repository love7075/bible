And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. </p><p> 21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him. </p><p> 22 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. </p><p> 23 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying, </p><p> 24 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah. </p><p> 25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: </p><p> 26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there. </p><p> 27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. </p><p> 28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. </p><p> 29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/num/19">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/num/21">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
