And they built for Pharaoh treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses. </p><p> 12 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. </p><p> 13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigour: </p><p> 14 And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in morter, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service, wherein they made them serve, was with rigour. </p><p> 15 And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah: </p><p> 16 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill him: but if it be a daughter, then she shall live. </p><p> 17 But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the men children alive. </p><p> 18 And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the men children alive? </p><p> 19 And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women; for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them. </p><p> 20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and waxed very mighty. </p><p> 21 And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. </p><p> 22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/exo/0">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/exo/2">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
