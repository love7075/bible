These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel. </p><p> 7 And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. </p><p> 8 And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people unto the LORD. </p><p> 9 And the LORD said unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people unto the LORD. </p><p> 10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes, </p><p> 11 And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. </p><p> 12 And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: </p><p> 13 There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. </p><p> 14 And Moses went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. </p><p> 15 And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives. </p><p> 16 And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled. </p><p> 17 And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. </p><p> 18 And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. </p><p> 19 And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. </p><p> 20 And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. </p><p> 21 And the LORD said unto Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. </p><p> 22 And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. </p><p> 23 And Moses said unto the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. </p><p> 24 And the LORD said unto him, Away, get thee down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. </p><p> 25 So Moses went down unto the people, and spake unto them. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/exo/18">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/exo/20">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
