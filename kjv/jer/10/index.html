Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good. </p><p> 6 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might. </p><p> 7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee. </p><p> 8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities. </p><p> 9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men. </p><p> 10 But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation. </p><p> 11 Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens. </p><p> 12 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion. </p><p> 13 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. </p><p> 14 Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. </p><p> 15 They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. </p><p> 16 The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name. </p><p> 17 Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress. </p><p> 18 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so. </p><p> 19 Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it. </p><p> 20 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains. </p><p> 21 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered. </p><p> 22 Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons. </p><p> 23 O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps. </p><p> 24 O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing. </p><p> 25 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jer/9">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jer/11">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
