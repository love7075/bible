I go to prepare a place for you. </p><p> 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. </p><p> 4 And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. </p><p> 5 Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? </p><p> 6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. </p><p> 7 If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. </p><p> 8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. </p><p> 9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father? </p><p> 10 Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. </p><p> 11 Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works&#39; sake. </p><p> 12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. </p><p> 13 And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. </p><p> 14 If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it. </p><p> 15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. </p><p> 16 And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; </p><p> 17 Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. </p><p> 18 I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. </p><p> 19 Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. </p><p> 20 At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you. </p><p> 21 He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. </p><p> 22 Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? </p><p> 23 Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. </p><p> 24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father&#39;s which sent me. </p><p> 25 These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you. </p><p> 26 But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you. </p><p> 27 Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. </p><p> 28 Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I. </p><p> 29 And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe. </p><p> 30 Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. </p><p> 31 But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/13">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/15">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
