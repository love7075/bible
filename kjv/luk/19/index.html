Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: </p><p> 23 Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? </p><p> 24 And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. </p><p> 25 (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) </p><p> 26 For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. </p><p> 27 But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. </p><p> 28 And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem. </p><p> 29 And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, </p><p> 30 Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither. </p><p> 31 And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. </p><p> 32 And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. </p><p> 33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? </p><p> 34 And they said, The Lord hath need of him. </p><p> 35 And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. </p><p> 36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. </p><p> 37 And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen; </p><p> 38 Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. </p><p> 39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. </p><p> 40 And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out. </p><p> 41 And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, </p><p> 42 Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. </p><p> 43 For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, </p><p> 44 And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. </p><p> 45 And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; </p><p> 46 Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves. </p><p> 47 And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, </p><p> 48 And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/luk/18">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/luk/20">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
