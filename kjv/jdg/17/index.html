And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son. </p><p> 3 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. </p><p> 4 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah. </p><p> 5 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. </p><p> 6 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes. </p><p> 7 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. </p><p> 8 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. </p><p> 9 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place. </p><p> 10 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in. </p><p> 11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. </p><p> 12 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. </p><p> 13 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jdg/16">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jdg/18">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
