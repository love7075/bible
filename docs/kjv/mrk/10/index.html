But Jesus answereth again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God! </p><p> 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. </p><p> 26 And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, Who then can be saved? </p><p> 27 And Jesus looking upon them saith, With men it is impossible, but not with God: for with God all things are possible. </p><p> 28 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee. </p><p> 29 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel&#39;s, </p><p> 30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life. </p><p> 31 But many that are first shall be last; and the last first. </p><p> 32 And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid. And he took again the twelve, and began to tell them what things should happen unto him, </p><p> 33 Saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests, and unto the scribes; and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles: </p><p> 34 And they shall mock him, and shall scourge him, and shall spit upon him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again. </p><p> 35 And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire. </p><p> 36 And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you? </p><p> 37 They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. </p><p> 38 But Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? </p><p> 39 And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized: </p><p> 40 But to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give; but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared. </p><p> 41 And when the ten heard it, they began to be much displeased with James and John. </p><p> 42 But Jesus called them to him, and saith unto them, Ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and their great ones exercise authority upon them. </p><p> 43 But so shall it not be among you: but whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: </p><p> 44 And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all. </p><p> 45 For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many. </p><p> 46 And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great number of people, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging. </p><p> 47 And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out, and say, Jesus, thou son of David, have mercy on me. </p><p> 48 And many charged him that he should hold his peace: but he cried the more a great deal, Thou son of David, have mercy on me. </p><p> 49 And Jesus stood still, and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Be of good comfort, rise; he calleth thee. </p><p> 50 And he, casting away his garment, rose, and came to Jesus. </p><p> 51 And Jesus answered and said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I might receive my sight. </p><p> 52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mrk/9">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mrk/11">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
