Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. </p><p> 16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon. </p><p> 17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. </p><p> 18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. </p><p> 19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. </p><p> 20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. </p><p> 21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/rev/15">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/rev/17">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
