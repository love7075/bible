And I was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with me. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/ezr/6">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/ezr/8">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
