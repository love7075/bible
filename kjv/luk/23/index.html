And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it. </p><p> 4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. </p><p> 5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place. </p><p> 6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. </p><p> 7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod&#39;s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time. </p><p> 8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. </p><p> 9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. </p><p> 10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. </p><p> 11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate. </p><p> 12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. </p><p> 13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, </p><p> 14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: </p><p> 15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. </p><p> 16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him. </p><p> 17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) </p><p> 18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas: </p><p> 19 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) </p><p> 20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them. </p><p> 21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. </p><p> 22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go. </p><p> 23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. </p><p> 24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. </p><p> 25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will. </p><p> 26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus. </p><p> 27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. </p><p> 28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. </p><p> 29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. </p><p> 30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. </p><p> 31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? </p><p> 32 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. </p><p> 33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. </p><p> 34 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. </p><p> 35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God. </p><p> 36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, </p><p> 37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. </p><p> 38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. </p><p> 39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us. </p><p> 40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? </p><p> 41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. </p><p> 42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. </p><p> 43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise. </p><p> 44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. </p><p> 45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. </p><p> 46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. </p><p> 47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. </p><p> 48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. </p><p> 49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things. </p><p> 50 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just: </p><p> 51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. </p><p> 52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. </p><p> 53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. </p><p> 54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. </p><p> 55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. </p><p> 56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/luk/22">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/luk/24">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
