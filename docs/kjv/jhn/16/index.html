And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you. </p><p> 5 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? </p><p> 6 But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart. </p><p> 7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. </p><p> 8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: </p><p> 9 Of sin, because they believe not on me; </p><p> 10 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; </p><p> 11 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged. </p><p> 12 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. </p><p> 13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come. </p><p> 14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you. </p><p> 15 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you. </p><p> 16 A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father. </p><p> 17 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? </p><p> 18 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith. </p><p> 19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me? </p><p> 20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. </p><p> 21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. </p><p> 22 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you. </p><p> 23 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you. </p><p> 24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full. </p><p> 25 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. </p><p> 26 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: </p><p> 27 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. </p><p> 28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father. </p><p> 29 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. </p><p> 30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God. </p><p> 31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe? </p><p> 32 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. </p><p> 33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/15">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/17">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
