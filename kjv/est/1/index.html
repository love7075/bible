Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath. </p><p> 19 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she. </p><p> 20 And when the king&#39;s decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small. </p><p> 21 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan: </p><p> 22 For he sent letters into all the king&#39;s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be published according to the language of every people. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/est/0">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/est/2">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
