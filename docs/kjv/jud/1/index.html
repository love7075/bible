Amen. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jud/0">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/rev/1">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
