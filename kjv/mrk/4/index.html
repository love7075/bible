And there were also with him other little ships. </p><p> 37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. </p><p> 38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish? </p><p> 39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. </p><p> 40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith? </p><p> 41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him? </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mrk/3">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mrk/5">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
