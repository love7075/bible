And the fourth river is Euphrates. </p><p> 15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. </p><p> 16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: </p><p> 17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. </p><p> 18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him. </p><p> 19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. </p><p> 20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him. </p><p> 21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof; </p><p> 22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. </p><p> 23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man. </p><p> 24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. </p><p> 25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/1">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/3">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
