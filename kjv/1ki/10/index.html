So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants. </p><p> 14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, </p><p> 15 Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country. </p><p> 16 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. </p><p> 17 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. </p><p> 18 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. </p><p> 19 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays. </p><p> 20 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. </p><p> 21 And all king Solomon&#39;s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of Solomon. </p><p> 22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. </p><p> 23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. </p><p> 24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. </p><p> 25 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. </p><p> 26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at Jerusalem. </p><p> 27 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance. </p><p> 28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the king&#39;s merchants received the linen yarn at a price. </p><p> 29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did they bring them out by their means. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1ki/9">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1ki/11">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
