Selah. </p><p> 5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints. </p><p> 6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD? </p><p> 7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him. </p><p> 8 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee? </p><p> 9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them. </p><p> 10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm. </p><p> 11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. </p><p> 12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name. </p><p> 13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand. </p><p> 14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face. </p><p> 15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance. </p><p> 16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted. </p><p> 17 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted. </p><p> 18 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king. </p><p> 19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people. </p><p> 20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him: </p><p> 21 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him. </p><p> 22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him. </p><p> 23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him. </p><p> 24 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted. </p><p> 25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers. </p><p> 26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation. </p><p> 27 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth. </p><p> 28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him. </p><p> 29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven. </p><p> 30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments; </p><p> 31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments; </p><p> 32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes. </p><p> 33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail. </p><p> 34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips. </p><p> 35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David. </p><p> 36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me. </p><p> 37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah. </p><p> 38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed. </p><p> 39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground. </p><p> 40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin. </p><p> 41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours. </p><p> 42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. </p><p> 43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle. </p><p> 44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground. </p><p> 45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah. </p><p> 46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire? </p><p> 47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain? </p><p> 48 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah. </p><p> 49 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth? </p><p> 50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people; </p><p> 51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed. </p><p> 52 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/psa/88">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/psa/90">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
