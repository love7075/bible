If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household? </p><p> 26 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known. </p><p> 27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops. </p><p> 28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. </p><p> 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. </p><p> 30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. </p><p> 31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows. </p><p> 32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. </p><p> 33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven. </p><p> 34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. </p><p> 35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law. </p><p> 36 And a man&#39;s foes shall be they of his own household. </p><p> 37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. </p><p> 38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me. </p><p> 39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it. </p><p> 40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me. </p><p> 41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet&#39;s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man&#39;s reward. </p><p> 42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/mat/9">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/mat/11">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
