Now the sons of Jacob were twelve: </p><p> 23 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob&#39;s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun: </p><p> 24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin: </p><p> 25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel&#39;s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali: </p><p> 26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah&#39;s handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram. </p><p> 27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned. </p><p> 28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years. </p><p> 29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/34">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/36">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
