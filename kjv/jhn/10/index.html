I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father. </p><p> 19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings. </p><p> 20 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him? </p><p> 21 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? </p><p> 22 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter. </p><p> 23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon&#39;s porch. </p><p> 24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. </p><p> 25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father&#39;s name, they bear witness of me. </p><p> 26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you. </p><p> 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: </p><p> 28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. </p><p> 29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father&#39;s hand. </p><p> 30 I and my Father are one. </p><p> 31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him. </p><p> 32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me? </p><p> 33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God. </p><p> 34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods? </p><p> 35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken; </p><p> 36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God? </p><p> 37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not. </p><p> 38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him. </p><p> 39 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand, </p><p> 40 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode. </p><p> 41 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true. </p><p> 42 And many believed on him there. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/9">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/11">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
