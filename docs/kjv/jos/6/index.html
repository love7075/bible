Thus shalt thou do six days. </p><p> 4 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams&#39; horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets. </p><p> 5 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with the ram&#39;s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him. </p><p> 6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams&#39; horns before the ark of the LORD. </p><p> 7 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD. </p><p> 8 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams&#39; horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them. </p><p> 9 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. </p><p> 10 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout. </p><p> 11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp. </p><p> 12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. </p><p> 13 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams&#39; horns before the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets. </p><p> 14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days. </p><p> 15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times. </p><p> 16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath given you the city. </p><p> 17 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent. </p><p> 18 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing, lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it. </p><p> 19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the LORD. </p><p> 20 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city. </p><p> 21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword. </p><p> 22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot&#39;s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her. </p><p> 23 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel. </p><p> 24 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD. </p><p> 25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father&#39;s household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho. </p><p> 26 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it. </p><p> 27 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout all the country. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jos/5">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jos/7">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
