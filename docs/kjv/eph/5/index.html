He that loveth his wife loveth himself. </p><p> 29 For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: </p><p> 30 For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. </p><p> 31 For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh. </p><p> 32 This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church. </p><p> 33 Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/eph/4">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/eph/6">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
