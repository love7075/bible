For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. </p><p> 28 When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. </p><p> 29 And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. </p><p> 30 Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ&#39;s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me; </p><p> 31 That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints; </p><p> 32 That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed. </p><p> 33 Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/rom/14">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/rom/16">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
