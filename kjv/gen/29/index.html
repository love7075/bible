And they said, Of Haran are we. </p><p> 5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. </p><p> 6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep. </p><p> 7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed them. </p><p> 8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well&#39;s mouth; then we water the sheep. </p><p> 9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father&#39;s sheep: for she kept them. </p><p> 10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother&#39;s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother&#39;s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well&#39;s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother&#39;s brother. </p><p> 11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept. </p><p> 12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father&#39;s brother, and that he was Rebekah&#39;s son: and she ran and told her father. </p><p> 13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister&#39;s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things. </p><p> 14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month. </p><p> 15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother, shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy wages be? </p><p> 16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. </p><p> 17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured. </p><p> 18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter. </p><p> 19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me. </p><p> 20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her. </p><p> 21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in unto her. </p><p> 22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast. </p><p> 23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her. </p><p> 24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid. </p><p> 25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me? </p><p> 26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn. </p><p> 27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years. </p><p> 28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also. </p><p> 29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid. </p><p> 30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years. </p><p> 31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren. </p><p> 32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me. </p><p> 33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon. </p><p> 34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi. </p><p> 35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/28">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/30">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
