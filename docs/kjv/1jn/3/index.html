For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. </p><p> 9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. </p><p> 10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. </p><p> 11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. </p><p> 12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother&#39;s righteous. </p><p> 13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you. </p><p> 14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death. </p><p> 15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him. </p><p> 16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. </p><p> 17 But whoso hath this world&#39;s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? </p><p> 18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth. </p><p> 19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him. </p><p> 20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. </p><p> 21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God. </p><p> 22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. </p><p> 23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. </p><p> 24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1jn/2">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1jn/4">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
