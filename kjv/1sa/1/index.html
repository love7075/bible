And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were there. </p><p> 4 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions: </p><p> 5 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah: but the LORD had shut up her womb. </p><p> 6 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb. </p><p> 7 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat. </p><p> 8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved? am not I better to thee than ten sons? </p><p> 9 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the LORD. </p><p> 10 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD, and wept sore. </p><p> 11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his head. </p><p> 12 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli marked her mouth. </p><p> 13 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been drunken. </p><p> 14 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee. </p><p> 15 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD. </p><p> 16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken hitherto. </p><p> 17 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him. </p><p> 18 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more sad. </p><p> 19 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her. </p><p> 20 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD. </p><p> 21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow. </p><p> 22 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for ever. </p><p> 23 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck until she weaned him. </p><p> 24 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young. </p><p> 25 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli. </p><p> 26 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD. </p><p> 27 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my petition which I asked of him: </p><p> 28 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1sa/0">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1sa/2">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
