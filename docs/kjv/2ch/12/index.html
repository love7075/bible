And his mother&#39;s name was Naamah an Ammonitess. </p><p> 14 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the LORD. </p><p> 15 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. </p><p> 16 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2ch/11">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2ch/13">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
