And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines. </p><p> 16 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp. </p><p> 17 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. </p><p> 18 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king&#39;s house, and burnt the king&#39;s house over him with fire, and died, </p><p> 19 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the LORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did, to make Israel to sin. </p><p> 20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </p><p> 21 Then were the people of Israel divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri. </p><p> 22 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omri reigned. </p><p> 23 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri to reign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah. </p><p> 24 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria. </p><p> 25 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worse than all that were before him. </p><p> 26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities. </p><p> 27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his might that he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel? </p><p> 28 So Omri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead. </p><p> 29 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah began Ahab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years. </p><p> 30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD above all that were before him. </p><p> 31 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him. </p><p> 32 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria. </p><p> 33 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him. </p><p> 34 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1ki/15">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1ki/17">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
