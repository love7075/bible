</p><p> 14 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed. </p><p> 15 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man. </p><p> 16 And I heard a man&#39;s voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision. </p><p> 17 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision. </p><p> 18 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright. </p><p> 19 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be. </p><p> 20 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia. </p><p> 21 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king. </p><p> 22 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. </p><p> 23 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up. </p><p> 24 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people. </p><p> 25 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand. </p><p> 26 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days. </p><p> 27 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I rose up, and did the king&#39;s business; and I was astonished at the vision, but none understood it. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/dan/7">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/dan/9">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
