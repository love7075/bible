And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city. </p><p> 18 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him; </p><p> 19 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days. </p><p> 20 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: </p><p> 21 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father&#39;s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father&#39;s house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you. </p><p> 22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel. </p><p> 23 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her; </p><p> 24 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled his neighbour&#39;s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you. </p><p> 25 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die: </p><p> 26 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter: </p><p> 27 For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her. </p><p> 28 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found; </p><p> 29 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel&#39;s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days. </p><p> 30 A man shall not take his father&#39;s wife, nor discover his father&#39;s skirt. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/deu/21">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/deu/23">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
