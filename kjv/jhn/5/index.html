He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. </p><p> 24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. </p><p> 25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. </p><p> 26 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; </p><p> 27 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. </p><p> 28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, </p><p> 29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. </p><p> 30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. </p><p> 31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. </p><p> 32 There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. </p><p> 33 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth. </p><p> 34 But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. </p><p> 35 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. </p><p> 36 But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. </p><p> 37 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. </p><p> 38 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. </p><p> 39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. </p><p> 40 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. </p><p> 41 I receive not honour from men. </p><p> 42 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. </p><p> 43 I am come in my Father&#39;s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. </p><p> 44 How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only? </p><p> 45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust. </p><p> 46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. </p><p> 47 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/4">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/6">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
