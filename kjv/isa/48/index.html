I have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them. </p><p> 7 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. </p><p> 8 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb. </p><p> 9 For my name&#39;s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off. </p><p> 10 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. </p><p> 11 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory unto another. </p><p> 12 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last. </p><p> 13 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together. </p><p> 14 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans. </p><p> 15 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous. </p><p> 16 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me. </p><p> 17 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go. </p><p> 18 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: </p><p> 19 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me. </p><p> 20 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant Jacob. </p><p> 21 And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out. </p><p> 22 There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/isa/47">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/isa/49">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
