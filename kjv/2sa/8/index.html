And so the Moabites became David&#39;s servants, and brought gifts. </p><p> 3 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates. </p><p> 4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots. </p><p> 5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men. </p><p> 6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. </p><p> 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. </p><p> 8 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass. </p><p> 9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, </p><p> 10 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass: </p><p> 11 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued; </p><p> 12 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. </p><p> 13 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men. </p><p> 14 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David&#39;s servants. And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went. </p><p> 15 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people. </p><p> 16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; </p><p> 17 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe; </p><p> 18 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David&#39;s sons were chief rulers. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2sa/7">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2sa/9">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
