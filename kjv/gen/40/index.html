And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you. </p><p> 9 And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; </p><p> 10 And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: </p><p> 11 And Pharaoh&#39;s cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh&#39;s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh&#39;s hand. </p><p> 12 And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days: </p><p> 13 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh&#39;s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler. </p><p> 14 But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: </p><p> 15 For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon. </p><p> 16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head: </p><p> 17 And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head. </p><p> 18 And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days: </p><p> 19 Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee. </p><p> 20 And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh&#39;s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants. </p><p> 21 And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh&#39;s hand: </p><p> 22 But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them. </p><p> 23 Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gen/39">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gen/41">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
