Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. </p><p> 31 So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/gal/3">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/gal/5">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
