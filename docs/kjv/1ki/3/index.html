And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. </p><p> 16 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. </p><p> 17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. </p><p> 18 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. </p><p> 19 And this woman&#39;s child died in the night; because she overlaid it. </p><p> 20 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. </p><p> 21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear. </p><p> 22 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king. </p><p> 23 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. </p><p> 24 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. </p><p> 25 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. </p><p> 26 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it. </p><p> 27 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. </p><p> 28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1ki/2">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1ki/4">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
