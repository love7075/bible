And they filled them up to the brim. </p><p> 8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. </p><p> 9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, </p><p> 10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now. </p><p> 11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him. </p><p> 12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days. </p><p> 13 And the Jews&#39; passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem, </p><p> 14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: </p><p> 15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers&#39; money, and overthrew the tables; </p><p> 16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father&#39;s house an house of merchandise. </p><p> 17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up. </p><p> 18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? </p><p> 19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. </p><p> 20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? </p><p> 21 But he spake of the temple of his body. </p><p> 22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said. </p><p> 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did. </p><p> 24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, </p><p> 25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/1">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/3">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
