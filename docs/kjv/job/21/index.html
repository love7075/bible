God distributeth sorrows in his anger. </p><p> 18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. </p><p> 19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it. </p><p> 20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. </p><p> 21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst? </p><p> 22 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high. </p><p> 23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet. </p><p> 24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow. </p><p> 25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. </p><p> 26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. </p><p> 27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me. </p><p> 28 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked? </p><p> 29 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens, </p><p> 30 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. </p><p> 31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done? </p><p> 32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb. </p><p> 33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him. </p><p> 34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood? </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/job/20">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/job/22">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
