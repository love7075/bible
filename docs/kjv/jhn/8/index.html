But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. </p><p> 7 So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. </p><p> 8 And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. </p><p> 9 And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. </p><p> 10 When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? </p><p> 11 She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more. </p><p> 12 Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. </p><p> 13 The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true. </p><p> 14 Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. </p><p> 15 Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man. </p><p> 16 And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me. </p><p> 17 It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. </p><p> 18 I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me. </p><p> 19 Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also. </p><p> 20 These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come. </p><p> 21 Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. </p><p> 22 Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come. </p><p> 23 And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world. </p><p> 24 I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins. </p><p> 25 Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning. </p><p> 26 I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him. </p><p> 27 They understood not that he spake to them of the Father. </p><p> 28 Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things. </p><p> 29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him. </p><p> 30 As he spake these words, many believed on him. </p><p> 31 Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; </p><p> 32 And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. </p><p> 33 They answered him, We be Abraham&#39;s seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? </p><p> 34 Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin. </p><p> 35 And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever. </p><p> 36 If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. </p><p> 37 I know that ye are Abraham&#39;s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you. </p><p> 38 I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father. </p><p> 39 They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham&#39;s children, ye would do the works of Abraham. </p><p> 40 But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham. </p><p> 41 Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God. </p><p> 42 Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me. </p><p> 43 Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word. </p><p> 44 Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it. </p><p> 45 And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. </p><p> 46 Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me? </p><p> 47 He that is of God heareth God&#39;s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God. </p><p> 48 Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil? </p><p> 49 Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me. </p><p> 50 And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth. </p><p> 51 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. </p><p> 52 Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death. </p><p> 53 Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself? </p><p> 54 Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God: </p><p> 55 Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying. </p><p> 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad. </p><p> 57 Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? </p><p> 58 Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am. </p><p> 59 Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jhn/7">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jhn/9">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
