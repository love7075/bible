Woe unto their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves. </p><p> 10 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. </p><p> 11 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him. </p><p> 12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths. </p><p> 13 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people. </p><p> 14 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses. </p><p> 15 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts. </p><p> 16 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet: </p><p> 17 Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts. </p><p> 18 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon, </p><p> 19 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers, </p><p> 20 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings, </p><p> 21 The rings, and nose jewels, </p><p> 22 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins, </p><p> 23 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails. </p><p> 24 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty. </p><p> 25 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war. </p><p> 26 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/isa/2">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/isa/4">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
