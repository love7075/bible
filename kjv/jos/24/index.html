And they said, We are witnesses. </p><p> 23 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel. </p><p> 24 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey. </p><p> 25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem. </p><p> 26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the sanctuary of the LORD. </p><p> 27 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God. </p><p> 28 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance. </p><p> 29 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years old. </p><p> 30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash. </p><p> 31 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel. </p><p> 32 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph. </p><p> 33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/jos/23">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/jdg/1">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
