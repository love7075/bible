So the house of the LORD was perfected. </p><p> 17 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom. </p><p> 18 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/2ch/7">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/2ch/9">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> </body></html>
