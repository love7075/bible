使徒行传 18 </span> </div> <!-- 右侧：上一章 / 下一章 --> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 text-blue-600"> <a href="/kjv/act/17">上一章</a> <a href="/kjv/act/19">下一章</a> </div> </div>  <div class="p-2 gray-400"> <p> 1 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; </p><p> 2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them. </p><p> 3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers. </p><p> 4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks. </p><p> 5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was Christ. </p><p> 6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles. </p><p> 7 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man&#39;s house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. </p><p> 8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. </p><p> 9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: </p><p> 10 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city. </p><p> 11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. </p><p> 12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat, </p><p> 13 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law. </p><p> 14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you: </p><p> 15 But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters. </p><p> 16 And he drave them from the judgment seat. </p><p> 17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things. </p><p> 18 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow. </p><p> 19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. </p><p> 20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; </p><p> 21 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus. </p><p> 22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch. </p><p> 23 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. </p><p> 24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus. </p><p> 25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John. </p><p> 26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly. </p><p> 27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much which had believed through grace: </p><p> 28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/act/17">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/act/19">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
