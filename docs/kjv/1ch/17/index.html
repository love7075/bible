Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an house. </p><p> 11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom. </p><p> 12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever. </p><p> 13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee: </p><p> 14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore. </p><p> 15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David. </p><p> 16 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? </p><p> 17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast also spoken of thy servant&#39;s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD God. </p><p> 18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant. </p><p> 19 O LORD, for thy servant&#39;s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these great things. </p><p> 20 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. </p><p> 21 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt? </p><p> 22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God. </p><p> 23 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said. </p><p> 24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before thee. </p><p> 25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee. </p><p> 26 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant: </p><p> 27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever. </p> </div> <div class="flex justify-center gap-4 p-4"> <a href="/kjv/1ch/16">上一章</a><a href="/kjv/1ch/18">下一章</a> </div>   </div> </div> <div class="footer" data-astro-cid-sckkx6r4>2025</div> <script type="module" src="/_astro/Layout.astro_astro_type_script_index_0_lang.FZH9LrPD.js"></script> </body></html>
